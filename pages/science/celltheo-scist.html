        <td>Robert Hooke</td>
        <td>
            English polymath who introduced the idea of a “cell”. While observing thin pieces of cork under a microscope, 
            he saw small rooms which he named <i>cellula</i> (Latin for small room).
        </td>

    <tr>
        <td>Anton van Leeuwenhoek</td>
        <td>
            Known as the father of microbiology. He observed single-celled organisms under the microscope, which he called 
            animacules, later known as bacteria.
        </td>

    <tr>
        <td>Robert Brown</td>
        <td>
            A Scottish botanist who discovered the nucleus while studying plant cells.

    <tr>
        <td>Mathias Schleiden</td>
        <td>
            A German botanist who proposed that all plants are made of cells and that cells are the basic unit of life in plants.
        </td>

    <tr>
        <td>Theodor Schwann</td>
        <td>
            A German physiologist who extended Schleiden’s ideas to animals, concluding that all animals are made of cells.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Rudolf Virchow</td>
        <td>
            A German physician who opposed spontaneous generation and stated that all cells come from pre-existing cells 
            (<i>Omnis cellula e cellula</i>).
